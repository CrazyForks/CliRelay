// logModelRegistration records what each credential ended up serving.

// Which branch a credential takes, and how many models survive the exclusion and
// alias filters, is otherwise invisible: the panel shows a merged view and the
// registry has no read-only surface. Diagnosing "this account cannot serve model
// X" then means guessing at the branch, which has repeatedly been the slow part of
// real incidents.
//
// One line per credential at startup and on credential change is cheap, and names
// the branch so the next investigation starts from fact rather than inference.
