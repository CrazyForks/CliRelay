// Image-generation model registration.
//
// Chat model lists are curated: retired models are pruned so operators are not
// offered something upstream no longer serves. Image models must not be swept up
// in that pruning, and repeatedly were:
//
//   - They never appear in a provider's chat model listing, because generation is
//     served by a different endpoint. Absence there carries no signal about
//     availability, unlike a retired chat model.
//   - Every entitled account has them. gpt-image-2 is available to any Codex Plus
//     or Pro account, and the Grok Imagine models to any subscription that can
//     reach the media host.
//
// The result of getting this wrong is that a model the runtime can serve is not
// registered, so it cannot be selected, cannot be added to a channel group's
// allowed list, and reports itself as unavailable — while the credential detail
// panel happily shows it.
//
// This was previously fixed for xAI alone, inside its model fetch. Doing it per
// provider is what let Codex regress the same way, so it now applies to every
// provider that serves image models.
//
// It lives on the internal side because sdk packages may not import internal ones,
// and no sdk/cliproxy file does today. Widening that boundary for one helper would
// be the wrong trade.

// withRegisteredImageModels guarantees a provider's image-generation models are in
// the set registered for a credential.
//
// Models already present are left alone: a live definition is more current than the
// compiled-in one.
