// Static catalog merging for discovery results.
//
// For claude, codex and xai the runtime registers the *static* catalog and treats
// upstream discovery as supplementary — the ChatGPT manifest is gated by client
// version, and the Grok CLI gateway advertises a single chat model, so neither is a
// full catalog. That is already documented at the fetch call sites.
//
// The management panel, however, replaced its view with the discovery result. The
// effect was a model list narrower than what the deployment can actually route:
// gpt-image-2 is registered and serviceable for every Codex account, but vanished
// from the panel the moment an operator pressed refresh, which reads as "this
// account does not have that model".
//
// The merge is deliberately narrow. Discovery is authoritative for anything it can
// report: a chat model absent from the listing has been retired upstream, and
// resurrecting it from the compiled-in catalog would show operators models they
// cannot use. Only models the listing structurally cannot contain are restored —
// image generation lives on a different endpoint and never appears in a chat model
// listing, which is exactly why gpt-image-2 went missing while gpt-5.5 did not.

// mergeDiscoveryWithStaticCatalog restores the static models a provider's discovery
// endpoint cannot report, leaving everything else to discovery.
//
// Upstream wins on conflicting ids: when a provider does report a model, its live
// definition is more current than the compiled-in one. Providers whose discovery is
// authoritative pass through untouched.
